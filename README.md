# Build your product, not another (password) login
## About Hanko
Hanko is the open-source alternative for passwordless authentication, powered by a combination of magic links and WebAuthn-based biometrics, aka passkeys.

Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite a while now. But only since very recently, the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally there. With most devices now supporting WebAuthn right out of the box, and shipping with biometric sensors like Touch ID and Face ID, a truly fascinating login experience becomes possible and will replace passwords for good.

That's where Hanko comes in. Hanko enables a polished, end-to-end passwordless user experience on the web. Self-hosted or as a lean SaaS hosted by us (coming soon). API-first, small footprint, for developers.

**Try it now and never look back.**

Integrate Hanko in your web apps in just 5 minutes â€“ with a single line of code.

With Hanko, your users will be able to login to your web app with biometrics instead of passwords. On devices that do not support WebAuthn, or for the first-time login on a new device, a magic link (we call them passlinks) is automatically sent. If possible, the user is then guided to enroll their biometrics.

For us, this project is the sum of six years of experience implementing FIDO and WebAuthn-based authentication in many different applications and platforms. And we are happy to share this with you.
