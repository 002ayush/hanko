![Hanko â€“ Welcome to the post-password era](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20115649/158687556-291e08f7-6b54-43e1-afe9-d780f19d6382.svg)

# About Hanko
Hanko is open-source user authentication with a focus on moving the login beyond passwords, while being 100% deployable today â€“ without any compromise. Hanko is powered by [WebAuthn](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn)-based biometrics (passkeys).

**Build your web app login in just 5 minutes â€“ with a single line of code â€“ and never look back.**

Hanko is built and maintained by Hanko.io, a startup based in Kiel, Germany, and an active member in the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/company/hanko/). This project is the sum of 5+ years of experience implementing FIDO and WebAuthn-based authentication in many different applications and platforms. 
And we are happy to share this with you.

# We take you on the journey beyond passwords...
...and make sure your users won't get lost on the way. Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite some time. But until now, "passwordless" was mostly a compromise that only worked for some of the users and had some severe drawbacks that ultimately led to passwords still being present at almost every login. It's only very recently that the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally ready to truly move beyond passwords. 
With most devices now shipping with biometric sensors like Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello and supporting WebAuthn APIs (web and native) out of the box, it's enabling a truly fascinating login experience that has the potential to replace passwords for good.

# Build your product, not another (password) login
Implementing onboarding and authentication that benefit from end-to-end passwordless and biometric convenience through WebAuthn, but also handle all edge cases and recovery flows is not a simple task.

**That's where Hanko comes in:**

With Hanko, your users will be able to login to your apps with biometrics instead of passwords. On devices that do not support WebAuthn, or for the first-time login on a new device where no WebAuthn credential is available, an email passcode is used. But then, the user is always guided to enroll their biometrics.

- A polished, passwordless user experience
- Biometrics, WebAuthn (passkeys, FIDO Security Keys), passcodes
- Optional password authentication instead of email passcodes to make sure your users won't feel lost
- All edge cases are handled that normally will keep you busy much longer than you would like (e.g., account recovery, unsupported devices, multi-language UI & emails)
- Mobile app support is planned
- Self-hosted or as a lean SaaS hosted by us
- API-first, small footprint, cloud-native
