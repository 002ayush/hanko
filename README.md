# Everything you need to onboard and authenticate users
## About Hanko
Hanko is the open-source alternative for passwordless authentication, powered by a combination of magic links and WebAuthn-based biometrics, aka passkeys.

Passwordless logins have been promised to us for quite a while now. But only since very recently, the ecosystem of devices, browsers, and operating systems is finally there. With most devices now supporting WebAuthn right out of the box, and shipping with biometric sensors like Touch ID and Face ID, a truly fascinating login experience is possible.

That's where Hanko comes in. It enables a polished, end-to-end passwordless user experience on the web. Self-hosted or as a lean SaaS hosted by us (coming soon). API-first, small footprint, for developers.

Integrate Hanko in your web apps in just 5 minutes -- with a single line of code.

Try it now and never look back.
